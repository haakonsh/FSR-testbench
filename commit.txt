Changes:

* Changed the fsr_field_t member names.
* Changed the adc_buffer from a two dimensional array to a one dimensional array of a packed struct adc_struct_t
* Changed adc_init(), adc_sample_state(), and fsr_update() to accomodate the new adc_buffer
* Chenged multiplexer_init() in order to initialize the mux_state array with the appropriate multiplexer state structs
* Fixed a bug in nrf_drv_saadc.c where the NRF_SAADC_EVENT_CALIBRATEDONE would not fire. The corresponding interrupt was never enabled.
